      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Think about the last time you heard about star constellations. Was it from someone who thinks that their whole personality is based on their Zodiac sign? Most likely it was, and because of that I would like to make a website so people can learn the history of star constellations and what their true meaning. My website will show the history of star constellations, why I’m interested in star constellations, how and what star constellations the Greeks and Vikings used to navigate the world. I will be doing the research and siting all my resources so others can look for themselves. Thank you for your time, I hope you consider my offer to make this website.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience I’m making this for is people who are tired of hearing about zodiac signs and horoscopes. They will learn the real history of star constellations and their purpose. It is also for people who want to learn about the Greek constellations; how they were used, what each main one is shaped like, and the history behind the constellations. It is also for those who want to learn about the Norse constellations; how they were used, what each main one is shaped like, and the history behind the constellations.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Star constellations History 
        The word constellation is from the Latin term “constellatio” which loosely translates to “set of stars.” Some cave paintings found in Europe that are over 10,000 years old show images of star formations that are quite similar to the ones that we see now. The earliest records of constellations reach back to around 3,000 years ago when the ancient Babylonians (modern day Iraq) wrote the signs of the zodiac based on the information that was shared by their predecessors.

        Greek small history 
        Despite all their mysteries, our ancestors eventually realized that the motions of the stars were regular and predictable. This allowed them to come up for different uses for them: from religious and mythological purposes to agriculture and navigation. Not only did the stars allow farmers to plan ahead and form agriculture, sailors and travelers would also use the position of the stars to find their way among the seas, or hostile deserts. Long before the existence of GPS and smartphones, it was the stars which guided us.
        Norse small history  
        Despite a rich oral and written tradition, very little has been preserved, which is why the material is meagre. There are two major problems: the use of Latin and Greek/Roman names during the medieval period, and the Romanticism in the 19th century, where “new” names and traditions arose. Even today the ”New Age” movement invents new names and traditions. It is therefore important to look for reliable sources. 

        Interesting star constellations facts 
        1.	There are 88 constellations 
        In 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially recognized 88 constellations, 48 of which were recorded by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in his book ‘Almagest’ written around 150 AD.
        2.	Cantillations travel from east to west 
        Each night more stars and constellation begin to appear in the eastern part of the sky at dusk before moving across and disappearing over the western horizon by dawn. Likewise, those constellations which we had been able to see low near the western horizon after sunset will vanish from our view only to be replaced by constellations which had been higher in the sky at sunset just a few weeks earlier.

        3.	Some cantillations have families 
        A constellation family refers to a group of constellations located within the same region of the night sky. They usually take their names from their most important constellation, the most prolific of which is the Hercules Family containing 19 constellations.

        Greek constellations
        History 
        In their beginning, the knowledge of the constellations were handed down orally in the form of stories and lore from generation to generation. It wasn’t until the third century before our era that the poet Aratus described most of the constellations known to the Greeks in a poem called Phaenomena. Almost two centuries later, the Greek astronomer Ptolemy listed the 48 Greek constellations as we know them today. These 48 formed the basis for our modern constellation system. Not only that, but Ptolemy also drew up a catalog of 1022 stars, with estimates of their brightness. It is because of these historic works that the Greeks are usually credited with the origin of the constellations. As far as we know, they were the first to record their names. Orion, Scorpios, Cygnus, Cassiopeia or the Great Bear are just some of the constellations designated by the Greeks, and which we still know under the same name today. 
        
        Greek constellations 
        Ursa Major (The Bear)
        The constellation of Ursa Major is among the oldest constellations in the night sky, with a history dating back to ancient times. Ursa Major is referenced both in Homer and the Bible. Several tales and legends across the globe associate Ursa Major with a bear. The ancient Greeks associated the constellation with the myth of Callisto, the beautiful nymph who had sworn a vow of chastity to the goddess, Artemis.
        Cyguns (The Swan)
        Cygnus is a prominent constellation in the northern sky. Its name means “the swan” in Latin and it is also known as the Swan constellation.
        Cygnus is associated with the myth of Zeus and Leda in Greek mythology. The constellation is easy to find in the sky as it features a well-known asterism known as the Northern Cross. Cygnus was first catalogued the by Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century.
        Canes Venatici (The Hunting Dog)
        Canes Venatici has only one star brighter than magnitude 3.00 and two stars located within 10 parsecs (32.6 light years) of Earth. The brightest star in Canes Venatici is Cor Caroli, Alpha Canum Venaticorum. The nearest star, DG Canum Venaticorum (spectral class M4.0Ve), is only 25.89 light years distant from Earth. The constellation has four stars with known planets. In Ptolemy’s text, some of the stars in Boötes represent the Herdsman’s club. The translator loosely translated the Greek word for “club” (Κολλοροβος ) as “the spearshaft with a hook” (“al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb”). When the Arabic phrase he used was later translated to Latin, the translator mistook one of the words for kilāb, which means “dogs.”
        Leo (The Lion)
        The constellation was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century, along with all the other constellations of the zodiac. Leo is the 12th largest constellation in size, occupying an area of 947 square degrees. It is located in the second quadrant of the northern hemisphere (NQ2) and can be seen at latitudes between +90° and -65°. The Greeks associated Leo with the Nemean lion, the beast defeated by Heracles during the first of his twelve labors. Both Eratosthenes and Hyginus wrote that the lion was placed among the constellations because it was the king of beasts.

      <h3>Norse</h3>
      <p>
        History 
        Our main source of Norse mythology comes from the Eddas, the poetic Edda and prosaic (Snorre Sturlason’s) Edda. But there exist other sources with surprisingly few references to the sky, considering the mastery of the Norse navigation and seamanship; this indicates a fair knowledge of astronomy for navigation.
        Observations of the stars and the sun are important for navigation, but also as a way of telling time. Local landmarks are used in combination with observations to tell the time. But one notices that the Vikings were aware of the difference of “sun-time” and “star-time”. The existence of a Norse calendar is mentioned in the Icelandic chronicle “Íslendingabók”, where a calendar reform around AD955. A calendar used from the 8th century till the 12th century, when the Julian calendar where introduced. It is likely that the Icelandic calendar where based on astronomical observations.

        In Völuspa the origin of the stars and planets are mentioned, as well as their end at Ragnarök. The world was created from the body of the giant Ymer. His skull forms the firmament and is held in place by four dwarves, where sparks from Muspellheim form the stars. Their place in the sky was determined by the gods and some were given paths they will roam.
        Ulf's Keptr (Mouth of the Wolf)
        The Mouth of the Wolf ("Ulf's Keptr"), the Hyades, resembles a wolf's mouth. In Norse mythology there are two wolves hunting the sun and the moon. The mouth of the wolf is close to the ecliptic, and it can be interpreted as one of these wolves. An alternative explanation is that it symbolises the Fenrir Wolf, whose mouth is held open with a sword, The milky way is then formed by the foam from his mouth.

        Fiskikarlar (Fishermen)
        Orion is a well known constellation, and there are a number of names for Orion's belt of Norse origin. Beckman and Kålunds [7] use “Fiskikarlar,” the fishermen. Another name is “Friggs distaff.” These names seem to be used locally; the fishermen are used in Norway and Iceland, while Friggs distaff is used in Sweden.

        Karlvagn (Man's chariot)
        One of the most well known constellations is The Big Dipper, the Plough or Charles’ wain, which in the Nordic countries are called ”Karlavagnen”, the chariot of Karl or man. The wagon is easily identified, but the origin of the name is a source for discussion. One theory is that it is named after Charlemagne (Karl in Scandinavia) and of medieval origin.

        Asar Bardagi (The Asar Battlefield)
        One constellation which has a peculiar name is Auriga, which is called ”asar bardagi”. The battlefield or the fight of the asar. But asar is plural, so it might indicate the final battle for all asar, that is Ragnarök.
