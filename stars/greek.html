            <h2>Greek Constellations History</h2>
            <p>In their beginning, the knowledge of the constellations were handed down orally in the form of stories and lore from generation to generation. It wasn’t until the third century before our era that the poet Aratus described most of the constellations known to the Greeks in a poem called Phaenomena. Almost two centuries later, the Greek astronomer Ptolemy listed the 48 Greek constellations as we know them today. These 48 formed the basis for our modern constellation system. Not only that, but Ptolemy also drew up a catalog of 1022 stars, with estimates of their brightness. It is because of these historic works that the Greeks are usually credited with the origin of the constellations. As far as we know, they were the first to record their names. Orion, Scorpios, Cygnus, Cassiopeia or the Great Bear are just some of the constellations designated by the Greeks, and which we still know under the same name today. </p>

                <h3>Ursa Major (The Bear)</h3>
                <p>The constellation of Ursa Major is among the oldest constellations in the night sky, with a history dating back to ancient times. Ursa Major is referenced both in Homer and the Bible. Several tales and legends across the globe associate Ursa Major with a bear. The ancient Greeks associated the constellation with the myth of Callisto, the beautiful nymph who had sworn a vow of chastity to the goddess, Artemis.</p>

                <h3>Canes Venatici (The Hunting Dog)</h3>
                <p>Canes Venatici has only one star brighter than magnitude 3.00 and two stars located within 10 parsecs (32.6 light years) of Earth. The brightest star in Canes Venatici is Cor Caroli, Alpha Canum Venaticorum. The nearest star, DG Canum Venaticorum (spectral class M4.0Ve), is only 25.89 light years distant from Earth. The constellation has four stars with known planets. In Ptolemy’s text, some of the stars in Boötes represent the Herdsman’s club. The translator loosely translated the Greek word for “club” (Κολλοροβος ) as “the spearshaft with a hook” (“al-`aşā dhāt al-kullāb”). When the Arabic phrase he used was later translated to Latin, the translator mistook one of the words for kilāb, which means “dogs.”</p>

                <h3>Leo (The Lion)</h3>
                <p>The constellation was first catalogued by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century, along with all the other constellations of the zodiac. Leo is the 12th largest constellation in size, occupying an area of 947 square degrees. It is located in the second quadrant of the northern hemisphere (NQ2) and can be seen at latitudes between +90° and -65°. The Greeks associated Leo with the Nemean lion, the beast defeated by Heracles during the first of his twelve labors. Both Eratosthenes and Hyginus wrote that the lion was placed among the constellations because it was the king of beasts.</p>
