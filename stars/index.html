            <h2>Star constellations History </h2>
            <p>The word constellation is from the Latin term “constellatio” which loosely translates to “set of stars.” Some cave paintings found in Europe that are over 10,000 years old show images of star formations that are quite similar to the ones that we see now. The earliest records of constellations reach back to around 3,000 years ago when the ancient Babylonians (modern day Iraq) wrote the signs of the zodiac based on the information that was shared by their predecessors.</p>

                <h3>Greek Constellations</h3>
                <p>Despite all their mysteries, our ancestors eventually realized that the motions of the stars were regular and predictable. This allowed them to come up for different uses for them: from religious and mythological purposes to agriculture and navigation. Not only did the stars allow farmers to plan ahead and form agriculture, sailors and travelers would also use the position of the stars to find their way among the seas, or hostile deserts. Long before the existence of GPS and smartphones, it was the stars which guided us.</p>

                <h3>Norse Constellations</h3>
                <p>Despite a rich oral and written tradition, very little has been preserved, which is why the material is meagre. There are two major problems: the use of Latin and Greek/Roman names during the medieval period, and the Romanticism in the 19th century, where “new” names and traditions arose. Even today the ”New Age” movement invents new names and traditions. It is therefore important to look for reliable sources. </p>

                <h3>Interesting Star Constellations Facts</h3>
                <h4>1.	There are 88 constellations</h4>
                <p>In 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially recognized 88 constellations, 48 of which were recorded by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in his book ‘Almagest’ written around 150 AD.</p>
                <h4>2.	Cantillations travel from east to west </h4>
                <p>Each night more stars and constellation begin to appear in the eastern part of the sky at dusk before moving across and disappearing over the western horizon by dawn. Likewise, those constellations which we had been able to see low near the western horizon after sunset will vanish from our view only to be replaced by constellations which had been higher in the sky at sunset just a few weeks earlier.</p>
                <h4>3.	Some cantillations have families </h4>
                <p>A constellation family refers to a group of constellations located within the same region of the night sky. They usually take their names from their most important constellation, the most prolific of which is the Hercules Family containing 19 constellations.</p>
